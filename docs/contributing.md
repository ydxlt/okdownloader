# Contributing

Keeping the project small and stable limits our ability to accept new contributors. We are not seeking new committers at this time, but some small contributions are welcome.

If you’ve found a security problem, please follow our [bug bounty](https://square.github.io/okhttp/security/) program.

If you’ve found a bug, please contribute a failing test case so we can study and fix it.

If you have a new feature idea, please build it in an external library. There are [many libraries](https://square.github.io/okhttp/works_with_okhttp/) that sit on top or hook in via existing APIs. If you build something that integrates with OkDownloader, tell us so that we can link it!
